#this is a comment
#variables vs constants
#variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1name="speros stars"
Team2name= "croydon kebab"

#variables have a useful name
#variables store a value(can change)
#variables can NOT start witha number
#e.g. 1teamname="croydon kebab"
#tjis will cause a syntax error

#variables cannot have a space in the name 
#e.g. team name="croydon kebab"
#this will be a syntax error

#this is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW= 1
TWOPOINTER= 2
THREEPOINTER=3

#The values in a CONSTANT do NOT change
